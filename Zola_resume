<h2>PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Growing up in a TV-free household, I developed a love for puzzles, sparking my interest in automation and security. This led me to embark on self-financed learning journeys, such as becoming a System Administrator whilst being a full-time student, transitioning to a role as Junior DevOps Engineer to today as a Kubernetes Administrator working on projects that are the intersection of AI and software engineering.</p>

<p>A proactive, analytical, and versatile professional with diverse experience brainstorming and developing solutions for complex business problems in a variety of industries and domains.</p>
